        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I am a student in BITE program at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences. Currently I am on third
            semester of my studies.
            My main orientation is towards software engineering field. In addition to this, I am interested in UI/UX
            designs and prototyping of digital services.
        </p>
        <p>I have gained basic knowledge of programming skills from my studies and I am constantly taking it into
            further level
            with my practices and own projects. I feel like I will enjoy much as a backend developer as I am really interested and focused in
            solving problems and making business logics. But also I can fit in frontend development part as I have knowledge of UX/UI design.
            I would like to work in such a place where working environment is really collaborative
            and supportive for my personal growth.
        </p>
        <p>I am hard working, dedicated, punctual, and friendly person. I follow deadlines very preciously. </p>
