                <h3>IUPUI-HH Project</h3>
                <p>This was a collaboration project of four students from Haaga-Helia University and Indiana University.
                    We created a simple website about the challenges caused by COVID-19 upon students.

                <h3>Party App (Initial version)</h3>
                <p>Party App was our own group project during User Experience course at Haaga-Helia.
                    The idea was to bring people from different social media apps into a single party app to create
                    events, join events, and view events and many other features. We went through different steps of
                    user studies during this project.
                    we designed our initial version of app with marvel prototype.

                <h3>Party App (Final version)</h3>
                <p>This project was our final project for Prototying of Digital Services course at Haaga-Helia.
                    The initial idea was created in User Experience course and it was continued later. We have tried to
                    consider all design principles and better user experience techniques in our design. We went through
                    all plases of usability testing. We discovered some issues with our designs from different test
                    cases.
