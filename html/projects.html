                <h3>IUPUI-HH Project</h3>
                <p>This was a collaboration project of four students together from Haaga-Helia University and Indiana University.
                    We created a simple website about the challenges caused by COVID-19 upon students.

                <h3>Party App (Initial version)</h3>
                <p>Party App was our own group project during User Experience course at Haaga-Helia.
                    The idea was to bring people from different social media apps into a single party app to create
                    events, join events, and view events and many other features. We went through different steps of
                    user studies during this project.
                    we designed our initial version of app with marvel prototype.

                <h3>Party App (Final version)</h3>
                <p>This project was our final project for Prototying of Digital Services course at Haaga-Helia.
                    The initial idea was created in User Experience course and it was continued later. We have tried to
                    consider all design principles and better user experience techniques in our design. We went through
                    all plases of usability testing. We discovered some issues with our designs from different test
                    cases.

                <h3>Uni App</h3>
                <p>The idea of Uni App prototype was to deliver useful information regarding higher education system
                    in Finland. The app has many features including education, tution fees, accomodation, migration,
                    travel, working life and so on.

                <h3>CANA App</h3>
                <p>This was our prototying project targeted for nurses. Upon login if
                    nurse has shift on that day it will show the time remaining to start the shift. Time has its special
                    color coding depending upon the time
                    remaining to start shift. Nurses can see patients details only when they reach the workstation. In
                    addition to this, it has other main features to view shifts, book available shifts and so on. </p>
